From the get-go, I knew this was hard to hold
Like a crash, the whole thing spun out of control
Oh, on a wire, we were dancing
Two kids, no consequences
Pull the trigger without thinking
There's only one way down this road
It was like a time bomb set into motion
We knew that we were destined to explode
And if I had to pull you out of the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you go
We're like a time bomb
Gonna lose it, let's defuse it
Baby, we're like a time bomb
But I need it, wouldn't have it any other way
Well, there's no way out of this, so let's stay in
Every storm that comes also comes to an end
Oh, resistance is useless
Just two kids stupid and fearless
Like a bullet shooting the lovesick
There's only one way down this road (come on)
It was like a time bomb set into motion
We knew that we were destined to explode
And if I had to pull you out of the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you go
We're like a time bomb
Gonna lose it, let's defuse it
Baby, we're like a time bomb
But I need it, wouldn't have it any other way
Let me see those hands!
Got my heart in your hands
Like a time bomb ticking
It goes off; we start again
When it breaks, we fix it
I've got your heart in my hands
Like a time bomb ticking
We should know better
But we won't let go
It was like a time bomb set into motion
We knew that we were destined to explode
And if I had to pull you out of the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you let me go
We're like a time bomb
Gonna lose it, let's defuse it
Baby, we're like a time bomb
But I need it, wouldn't have it any other way
