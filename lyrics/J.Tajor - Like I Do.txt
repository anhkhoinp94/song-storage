Yeah-eh-eh
That's a drop-top coupe
Said you wanna drive it down real soon
I just wanna love you like I do
'Cause I never had someone like you
Ain't nobody got this love
Got me cuffed, ain't nobody, bae
All I need is love
I just wanna run away with you
I'm just hopin' that you see and you notice
Can't stop with the way I been fallin'
Fall back 'cause I'll catch when you're fallin' (when you're fallin')
I just need to know, you're mine when I'm callin'
Girl, let me provide your needs
Freaky girl under the sheets (oh woo)
But you love when things start slowin' down
I know you got me, baby
That's a drop-top coupe (ooh-ooh)
Said you wanna drive it down real soon

'Cause I never had someone like you
Ain't nobody got this love
Got me cuffed, ain't nobody, bae
All I need is love
I just wanna run away with you
Baby, say you love me 'cause that's all I need
Drop on a bag 'cause it's all on me, yeah
I put my trust in you 'cause I'm all in
I keep it tied up, too, I'm not stallin'
'Cause I can't hide all these feelings
My baby, your love got me trippin'
I'll show you just what I mean
'Cause you deserve all things you want, baby
That's a drop-top coupe (baby, baby, ooh-hoo)
Said you wanna drive it down real soon
